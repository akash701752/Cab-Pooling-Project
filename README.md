# Cab-Pooling-Project
The objective of our cab pooling website is to provide a convenient and cost-effective mode of transportation for daily commuters. By connecting individuals who share similar routes, we aim to reduce traffic congestion and carbon footprint while promoting social interaction among passengers. Our website also aims to improve the accessibility of public transportation by providing a reliable and easy-to-use platform for booking rides.
